========================

We're building infrastructure for the Share Economy.  Our goal is to faciliate sharing, trading, selling and giving of goods and services, great and small.  We wish to tap the enormous potential of all the inefficently and underused stuff stored in everyone's homes.  The impacts include greater conservation of resources, real savings through reuse, and beneficial social impacts as people share things, knowledge and experience.  Something like the *Internet of Things* meets the *Internet of Stuff (or Junk)* enabled by a meaningful and purposeful social network.  

A few examples include:

*	Neighborhoods ==> A convenient was to share power tools, stuff forgotten in your basement and friendly expertise.
*	Businesses ==> A fixed asset system.
*	Virtual Goods ==> Enable fluid markets in gaming environments.
